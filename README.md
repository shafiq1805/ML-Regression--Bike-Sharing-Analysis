# ML-Regression--Bike-Sharing-Analysis


**Uncover the secrets of bike sharing patterns and predict future rentals!**

This repository dives deep into bike sharing data to understand how weather, time, and other factors influence rental behavior. We visualize trends, test hypotheses, and build machine learning models to accurately forecast rental counts.

**Overview**
Cities worldwide are increasingly adopting bike sharing for sustainable transportation. Efficiently managing bike availability is crucial for service providers. This project presents a machine learning model that accurately forecasts bike rental demand, aiding in operational optimization.

**Project Highlights**
**Objective:** Predict the number of bike rentals for any given time period.
**Benefits:** Optimize bike availability, improve user experience, and enhance resource efficiency for bike-sharing service providers.
**Model:** Leveraged various regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and Polynomial Regression.
**Data Exploration:** Explored patterns, trends, and correlations in the dataset to gain insights.
**Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted hypothesis tests to validate correlations and differences in rental patterns.
**Feature Engineering:** Engineered features from date and time columns for improved model performance.
**Evaluation Metrics:** Employed metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared for model evaluation.
**Model Selection:** Explored multiple regression models and compared their performance.
**Power Transformation:** Applied power transformation for data normalization.
